🎮 Just built Arena Improver for the MCP-1st-Birthday Hackathon

It's an AI-powered MTG Arena deck optimizer that uses:
✨ Real-time meta data (Tavily/Exa MCP)
🤖 GPT-4 suggestions
📊 Performance tracking
🔓 100% open-source

Thread 🧵👇
```

**Tweet 2 (Problem):**
```
The problem: MTG Arena players rely on outdated meta snapshots and gut feelings for deck building

Traditional tools scrape data manually and can't adapt to rapid meta shifts

You're always one step behind the meta 📉
```

**Tweet 3 (Solution):**
```
Arena Improver solves this with Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Instead of static databases, it fetches LIVE meta data from:
• MTGGoldfish
• AetherHub
• Tournament results

Via Tavily & Exa MCP servers 🔍
```

**Tweet 4 (Demo):**
```
Here's how it works:

1. Export deck from Steam Arena (CSV)
2. Upload to Arena Improver
3. Get instant analysis vs CURRENT meta
4. Receive GPT-4 optimization suggestions
5. Track performance over time

**Tweet 5 (Technical):**
```
Built with 3 MCP servers:

🧠 @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
   → Learns your preferences

🔗 @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking
   → Multi-step deck optimization reasoning

🔍 cld-omnisearch
   → Real-time meta intelligence
```

**Tweet 6 (Features):**
```
Key features:

📊 Mana curve analysis (0-100 score)
🎯 Meta matchup predictions with win rates
💡 AI-powered card suggestions
📈 Historical performance tracking
🔎 Card similarity search (embeddings)
⚡ 8 MCP tools via stdio protocol
```

**Tweet 7 (Tech Stack):**
```
Tech stack:

• MCP 1.10.0 (protocol core)
• FastAPI + uvicorn (REST API)
• OpenAI GPT-4 (optimization)
• sentence-transformers (embeddings)
• SQLAlchemy + SQLite (persistence)
• Docker (deployment)

2,500 LOC | 59% test coverage
```

**Tweet 8 (Impact):**
```
Why this matters for MCP adoption:

1. Real-world gaming use case (10M+ MTG Arena players)
2. Showcases MCP interoperability (3 servers working together)
3. Demonstrates AI agent workflows
4. Open-source reference implementation

MCP isn't just for coding—it's for EVERYTHING

### LinkedIn Post (Professional)

**Headline**: Building Real-Time Intelligence Systems with Model Context Protocol

**Body**:
```
I'm excited to share my MCP-1st-Birthday Hackathon submission: Arena Improver, an AI-powered Magic: The Gathering Arena deck optimization platform.

🎯 The Challenge:
Competitive MTG Arena players need up-to-the-minute meta intelligence to make informed deck-building decisions. Traditional tools rely on manually updated databases that lag behind the rapidly shifting metagame.

💡 The Solution:
Arena Improver leverages Model Context Protocol (MCP) to integrate three complementary AI capabilities:

1. Real-Time Web Search (Tavily/Exa MCP)
   → Fetches current meta shares, tournament results, and professional decklists
   → No stale data—always current

2. Sequential Reasoning (Sequential Thinking MCP)
   → Multi-step optimization logic
   → Transparent decision-making process

3. Long-Term Memory (Memory MCP)
   → Player preference learning
   → Meta trend tracking over time

🛠️ Technical Architecture:
• Full MCP 1.10.0 implementation with 8 custom tools
• FastAPI REST API for HTTP integration
• OpenAI GPT-4 for context-aware suggestions
• sentence-transformers for card similarity
• Async SQLAlchemy for performance tracking
• Docker support for easy deployment

📊 Results:
✅ Real-time meta matchup predictions
✅ AI-powered optimization suggestions
✅ Historical performance analytics
✅ 2,500 LOC with 59% test coverage
✅ Comprehensive documentation

🔓 Open Source:
Released under AGPL-3.0 at github.com/clduab11/arena-improver

This project demonstrates how MCP enables rapid development of intelligent, interoperable systems by composing specialized AI services. The same patterns apply beyond gaming—customer support, data analysis, research, and more.

What domains would benefit most from MCP integration? I'd love to hear your thoughts! 💬

### Reddit Post (r/MagicArena, r/spikes)

**Title**: [Tool] Arena Improver - AI-Powered Deck Optimizer with Real-Time Meta Analysis

**Body**:
```markdown
Hey r/MagicArena!

I built **Arena Improver** for the MCP-1st-Birthday Hackathon—it's an open-source deck optimization tool that uses AI to analyze your decks against the *current* meta (not outdated snapshots).

## What It Does

Upload your deck (CSV from Steam Arena or text format) and get:

✅ **Real-time meta matchups** - Win rate predictions vs. current top archetypes
✅ **AI optimization suggestions** - GPT-4 powered card recommendations with reasoning
✅ **Mana curve analysis** - Scored 0-100 with ideal distribution comparison
✅ **Performance tracking** - Historical match data with trend analysis
✅ **Card similarity search** - Find replacements using AI embeddings

## Why It's Different

Traditional tools like MTGGoldfish and Archidekt use manually updated databases. Arena Improver fetches **live data** from multiple sources using Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration.

Current meta as of today (Nov 13, 2025):
- Boros Convoke: 15.8% (52.7% WR)
- Mono-Red Aggro: 14.2% (53.5% WR)
- Dimir Midrange: 12.5% (54.2% WR)
- Domain Ramp: 10.3% (51.8% WR)

## Example Output

```
YOUR DECK: "Experimental Dimir"
Overall Score: 67.5/100

META MATCHUPS:
✓ Favorable vs Boros Convoke:   55.0%
✓ Favorable vs Mono-Red Aggro:  52.5%
≈ Even vs Dimir Midrange:        50.0%
✗ Unfavorable vs Domain Ramp:   45.0%

AI SUGGESTIONS:
1. ADD: 2x Go for the Throat
   Reason: Strengthens removal suite against aggro
   Impact: 85/100

2. REPLACE: 2x Murder → 2x Cut Down
   Reason: More mana-efficient removal
   Impact: 75/100
```

## Try It Yourself

**Quick Start:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/clduab11/arena-improver
cd arena-improver
./scripts/setup.sh
# Add API keys to .env
uvicorn src.main:app --reload
```

Or use Docker:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

**Requirements:**
- OpenAI API key (for AI suggestions)
- Optional: Tavily/Exa keys (for enhanced meta data)

## Technical Details

- 100% open-source (AGPL-3.0)
- FastAPI REST API + MCP protocol support

### HackerNews Post

**Title**: Arena Improver – AI-powered MTG Arena deck optimizer built with Model Context Protocol

**Body**:
```
I built Arena Improver for the MCP-1st-Birthday Hackathon. It's an open-source tool that helps Magic: The Gathering Arena players optimize their decks using AI and real-time meta intelligence.

The interesting technical aspect is the use of Model Context Protocol (MCP) to compose three specialized AI services:

1. Tavily/Exa MCP for real-time web search (current meta data from MTGGoldfish, tournament results)
2. Sequential Thinking MCP for multi-step optimization reasoning
3. Memory MCP for long-term player preference learning

Instead of a monolithic architecture, MCP allows you to plug in specialized AI capabilities via a standard protocol. Each "MCP server" exposes tools that can be composed into workflows.

Example workflow:
- Parse deck (CSV from Steam Arena)
- Fetch current meta archetypes (Tavily search)
- Analyze matchups (local heuristics + meta data)
- Generate optimization suggestions (GPT-4 with context)
- Predict win rate improvement (GPT-4)

The FastAPI REST API and MCP server can run side-by-side, giving you both HTTP and stdio protocol access to the same functionality.

Tech stack: Python 3.9+, FastAPI, MCP 1.10.0, OpenAI GPT-4, sentence-transformers, SQLAlchemy, Docker.

Repo: https://github.com/clduab11/arena-improver

Happy to answer questions about MCP integration, prompt engineering for MTG, or the architecture!
