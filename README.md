## 🎯 What This Is

Listen up. I'm **Vawlrathh, The Small'n**—a pint-sized, sharp-tongued version of Volrath, The Fallen. Despite my stature, I know MTG Arena better than you know your own deck (which, frankly, isn't saying much).

I'm an MCP-powered deck analysis tool that actually works. I analyze your janky brews, tells you what's wrong (plenty), and help you build something that won't embarrass you at FNM.

Designed for **Steam Arena players** who want to win games, not just collect pretty digital cards.

### What Makes This Not-Garbage

- **Physical Card Prices**: Shows you what your Arena deck costs in real cardboard (excludes Arena-only nonsense)
- **Real-Time Strategy Chat**: Talk to me via WebSocket. I'll tell you the truth, even if you don't want to hear it
- **AI Consensus Checking**: Two AI brains (mine and a validator) so you don't get bad advice
- **Sequential Reasoning**: Breaks down complex decisions into steps even you can follow
- **Full MCP Integration**: Memory, sequential thinking, omnisearch—the works

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### What You Need

Don't skip this part. I hate repeating myself.

- Python 3.9+ (If you're still on 2.7, we have bigger problems)
- Node.js 18+ (For MCP servers)
- Docker (Optional, for the lazy)

**API Keys** (Get these or nothing works):
- **OpenAI**: For the smart stuff
- **Anthropic**: For consensus checking
- **Tavily/Exa**: For meta intelligence (highly recommended)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone it
git clone https://github.com/clduab11/arena-improver.git
cd arena-improver

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up your keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys. All of them.

# Initialize database
python -c "import asyncio; from src.services.smart_sql import SmartSQLService; asyncio.run(SmartSQLService().init_db())"
```

Done? Good. Moving on.

## 💬 Meet Vawlrathh (That's Me)

I'm not your friend. I'm your strategic advisor. Here's how I work:

### Personality Traits

- **Dry-Witted**: Sarcasm is my first language
- **Brusque**: No fluff, no sugar-coating
- **Pragmatic**: If it works, it's good. If it doesn't, it's trash
- **Knowledgeable**: Volrath's cunning, just... shorter

### Example Interactions

**You**: "Rate my deck"
**Me**: "Your mana curve's a disaster. Fix it."

**You**: "Should I play best-of-one or best-of-three?"
**Me**: "If you have to ask, stick to Bo1. Less time to screw up."

**You**: "What do you think of my sideboard?"
**Me**: "I've seen better sideboards from goblins. Try again."

## 🛠️ Core Features

### 1. Physical Card Purchase Integration

**Problem**: You want to build your Arena deck in paper, but half the cards don't exist.

**Solution**: I check every card, filter out Arena-only garbage, and show you prices from TCGPlayer, CardMarket, and Cardhoarder.

```bash
# Get purchase info for deck ID 1
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/purchase/1"
```

**Response includes**:
- Total deck cost (only real cards)
- Per-card pricing
- Vendor comparisons
- Arena-only card warnings

### 2. Real-Time Chat (Talk to Me)

WebSocket endpoint: `ws://localhost:8000/api/v1/ws/chat/{your_id}`

**Message Format**:
```json
{
  "type": "chat",
  "message": "How do I beat control decks?",
  "context": {
    "deck_id": 1
  }
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "type": "response",
  "response": "Pack hand disruption. Duress is cheap. Use it.",
  "consensus_checked": true,
  "consensus_passed": true
}
```

If I say something wrong (rare), you'll get a `ConsensusBreaker` warning. Pay attention to those.

### 3. Deck Analysis That Doesn't Lie

```bash
POST /api/v1/analyze/1
```

Gets you:
- Mana curve (yours is probably bad)
- Meta matchups (real tournament data)
- Card synergies
- Weaknesses (plenty to choose from)
- **Physical card purchase info** (automatically included)

### 4. AI-Powered Optimization

```bash
POST /api/v1/optimize/1
```

I'll suggest:
- Cards to add
- Cards to cut
- Why each change matters
- Predicted win rate improvement
- Purchase links for suggested cards

### 5. Sequential Reasoning

For complex decisions (like "should I build this deck?"), I break it down:

1. What's the win condition?
2. What are the mana requirements?
3. Which meta decks do you need to beat?
4. What are the critical early plays?
5. What sideboard cards are essential?
6. What's the optimal curve?

Each step gets analyzed. You get conclusions you can actually use.

## 🎮 Steam Arena Focus

This tool is built for Steam Arena. Here's why that matters:

- **CSV Import**: Native Steam export support
- **Platform-Specific Meta**: Steam ladder is different from Magic Online
- **Bo1 vs Bo3**: Strategy adjusts based on queue type
- **Collection Integration**: Coming soon—sync your Steam collection

### Quick Steam Export

1. Open your deck in Arena (Steam version)
2. Click "Export" → Choose "CSV"
3. Upload to Arena Improver:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/upload/csv" \
  -F "file=@my_deck.csv"
```

Done. Moving on.

## 🤝 Contributing

Want to improve this? Fine. Here's how:

1. Fork it
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`
3. Write tests (or I'll reject it)
4. Make sure tests pass: `pytest`
5. Commit: `git commit -m 'Add YourFeature'`
6. Push: `git push origin feature/YourFeature`
7. Open a Pull Request

### Automated PR Reviews (Claude)

Need an automated once-over before pinging humans? Add the `claude-review` label to your PR and the Claude workflow will spin up exactly one review per commit. The workflow uses concurrency guards (one active run per PR via `concurrency.group`) and duplicate detection (scans existing comments for `<!-- claude-review:{SHA} -->` tags), so you will not get stacks of identical GitHub Action runs cluttering the Checks tab or redundant comment spam. Want a fresh pass after changes? Remove the label (or re-apply it) and push a new commit—the workflow will recognize the new head SHA and post a single consolidated review comment tagged with that SHA. Only one review per SHA is ever posted.

### What I Want

- Meta intelligence improvements
- More purchase vendor integrations
- Better matchup prediction models
- MCP tool enhancements
- Bug fixes (obviously)

### What I Don't Want

- Unnecessary complexity
- Features without tests
- Breaking changes without discussion
- Bad code (you know what I mean)

## 💭 Final Thoughts from Vawlrathh

Look, your deck's probably still bad. But with this tool, at least you'll know *why* it's bad and *how* to fix it.

I don't do participation trophies. I do win rates.

Use the sequential reasoning for complex decisions. Talk to me via WebSocket for quick advice. Check purchase prices before you waste money on paper cards you don't need.

And for the love of Phyrexia, **read the error messages** before asking for help.

Now go build something decent.

— **Vawlrathh, The Small'n**
*Diminutive in size, not in strategic prowess*

**P.S.** If you're reading this far down, you might actually care about winning. Good. The demo's at `examples/hackathon_demo.py`. Run it. Learn something.

**P.P.S.** Your mana curve still needs work.
