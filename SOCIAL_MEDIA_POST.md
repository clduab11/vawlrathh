🎉 Excited to share my submission for the MCP 1st Birthday Hackathon!

🔥 Introducing Vawlrathh - An MCP-Powered MTG Arena Deck Analyzer

After an intensive build sprint, I've created a fully-featured deck analysis tool that combines AI personality with serious strategic analysis for Magic: The Gathering Arena players.

🎯 Key Features:

✅ 9 Custom MCP Tools - Built from scratch for deck parsing, analysis, optimization, and card market lookups

✅ Dual-AI Consensus System - Primary analysis by GPT-4, validated by Claude Sonnet to prevent hallucinations and ensure accurate advice

✅ Physical Card Pricing - Unique integration showing what your Arena deck costs in real cardboard (TCGPlayer, CardMarket, Cardhoarder), with automatic Arena-only card filtering

✅ Real-Time Chat - WebSocket-powered conversation with Vawlrathh, complete with personality and consensus checking visible to users

✅ Sequential Reasoning - MCP-powered step-by-step strategic analysis for complex questions

✅ External MCP Integration - Memory server, Sequential Thinking, and cld-omnisearch (Tavily/Exa) for real-time meta intelligence

🏗️ Technical Stack:
• Frontend: Gradio 4+ (Python UI framework)
• Backend: FastAPI (async Python)
• AI: GPT-4, Claude Sonnet
• Protocol: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
• Data: Scryfall API, Tavily, Exa
• Deployment: HuggingFace Spaces with GitHub Actions auto-sync

🎨 What Makes It Special:

This isn't just another deck analyzer. Vawlrathh has a distinct personality - sarcastic, brutally honest, and pragmatic. The character-driven UX makes strategic advice memorable and engaging, while the MCP integration ensures technical depth and reliability.

The physical card pricing feature is unique in the MTG Arena space. Most tools focus on Arena-only strategies, but I bridge the gap to paper Magic by showing real-world costs and automatically filtering Arena-exclusive cards.

### Post Body:

Hey r/MagicArena! 👋

I just finished building **Vawlrathh** for the MCP 1st Birthday Hackathon, and I thought you folks might find it useful (or at least entertaining).

## What is it?

Vawlrathh is an MCP-powered deck analyzer that gives you brutally honest strategic advice for your MTG Arena decks. Think of it as a sarcastic, pint-sized Volrath who knows the Arena meta inside-out.

## Key Features:

**✅ Dual-AI Consensus Checking**
- Primary analysis by GPT-4
- Validated by Claude Sonnet to prevent hallucinations
- You see both AI responses and consensus badges

**✅ Physical Card Pricing** (This is the killer feature IMO)
- Shows what your Arena deck costs in real cardboard
- Prices from TCGPlayer, CardMarket, and Cardhoarder
- Automatically filters Arena-only cards (goodbye, Alchemy!)
- Per-card breakdown with vendor comparison

**✅ Real-Time Chat**
- WebSocket-powered conversation
- Ask strategic questions: "Should I add more removal?" "How do I beat Esper Control?"
- Responses are consensus-checked before you see them

**✅ Full Deck Analysis**
- Mana curve optimization
- Meta matchup predictions (based on real tournament data via Tavily/Exa)
- Card synergy analysis
- Strengths/weaknesses breakdown

**✅ MCP Integration**
- 9 custom MCP tools (deck parsing, analysis, optimization, card lookups, etc.)
- External MCP servers for memory and sequential reasoning
- Complete audit trail of all MCP invocations

## How It Works:

1. Upload your deck (CSV from Steam Arena or text export)
2. Get instant analysis with Vawlrathh's verdict
3. Ask questions via chat (all responses consensus-checked)
4. See physical card prices if you want to build in paper
5. Get optimization suggestions with predicted win rate improvement

## Tech Stack:

- **Frontend:** Gradio 4+ (Python)
- **Backend:** FastAPI (async)
- **AI:** GPT-4 + Claude Sonnet dual-AI system
- **MCP:** 9 custom tools + 3 external servers
- **Data:** Scryfall API, Tavily, Exa

## Try It:

🔗 **Live Demo:** https://huggingface.co/spaces/MCP-1st-Birthday/vawlrathh
🔗 **GitHub:** https://github.com/clduab11/vawlrathh

## Example Interaction:

**You:** "Rate my Mono Red Aggro deck"
**Vawlrathh:** "Your mana curve's a disaster. You've got 8 cards at 3 CMC and nothing to do on turn 1. Add 4x Kumano Faces Kakkazan. Cut 2x Roiling Vortex - they're win-more." *[✓ Consensus Pass]*

## Feedback Welcome!

This was built for the MCP 1st Birthday Hackathon, and I'd love to hear what you think. What features would make this more useful for Arena grinders?
